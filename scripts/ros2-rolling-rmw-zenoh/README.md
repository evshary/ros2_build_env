# ROS 2 Rolling with rmw_zenoh

Able to build rmw_zenoh inside rolling

## Step

* Build the code

```shell
source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash
# Download the code and dependencies. Then build it.
just scripts/ros2-rolling-rmw-zenoh/all

# Option 1: Only build after modifying the code
just scripts/ros2-rolling-rmw-zenoh/build

# Option 2: Install dependency at the first time running docker
# if you've already built it before and want to run it directly.
just scripts/ros2-rolling-rmw-zenoh/dependency
```

* Test navigation2

```shell
# prerequisites: need to build nav2 first
source ros2_rolling_nav2_ws/install/local_setup.bash
# terminal 1
source ros2_rolling_rmw_zenoh_ws/install/local_setup.bash
ros2 run rmw_zenoh_cpp rmw_zenohd
# terminal 2
## Necessary if GPU has some issues
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
## Use rmw_zenoh
source ros2_rolling_rmw_zenoh_ws/install/local_setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_zenoh_cpp
## Run navigation2
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:/opt/ros/rolling/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/models
ros2 launch nav2_bringup tb3_simulation_launch.py headless:=False
## Run rviz2 and gazebo separately
ros2 launch nav2_bringup rviz_launch.py
ros2 launch nav2_bringup tb3_simulation_launch.py headless:=False use_rviz:=False
## You might need this if using WAYLAND
## https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/troubleshooting/#wayland-issues
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb ros2 launch nav2_bringup tb3_simulation_launch.py headless:=False
```

* Clean the project

```shell
just scripts/ros2-rolling-rmw-zenoh/clean
```
